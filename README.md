Tinker-HP is a CPU based, double precision, massively parallel package dedicated to long polarizable molecular dynamics simulations and 
to polarizable QM/MM. Tinker-HP is an evolution of the popular Tinker package that conserves it simplicity of use but brings new 
capabilities allowing performing very long molecular dynamics simulations on modern supercomputers that use thousands of cores. 
The Tinker-HP approach offers various strategies using domain decomposition techniques for periodic boundary conditions in the 
framework of the (n)log(n) Smooth Particle Mesh Ewald.  Tinker-HP proposes a high performance scalable computing environment for 
polarizable force fields giving access to large systems up to millions of atoms. It can be used on supercomputers as well as on lab clusters.
