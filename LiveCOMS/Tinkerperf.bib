In a first part, we chose the particular case of the Th(IV) cation to demonstrate the capabilities of the AMOEBA polarizable force field to reproduce both reference ab initio gas-phase energetics and experimental data including coordination numbers and radial distribution functions. Using such model, we predicted the first polarizable force field estimate of Th(IV) solvation free energy, which accounts for âˆ’1,638Âkcal/mol. In addition, we proposed in a second part of this work a full extension of the SIBFA (Sum of Interaction Between Fragments Ab initio computed) polarizable potential to lanthanides (La(III) and Lu(III)) and to actinides (Th(IV)) in water. We demonstrate its capabilities to reproduce all ab initio contributions as extracted from energy decomposition analysis computations, including many-body charge transfer and discussed its applicability to extended molecular dynamics and its parametrization on high-level post-Hartree--Fock data.",

abstract = {Abstract We describe here a general Amber force field (GAFF) for organic molecules. GAFF is designed to be compatible with existing Amber force fields for proteins and nucleic acids, and has parameters for most organic and pharmaceutical molecules that are composed of H, C, N, O, S, P, and halogens. It uses a simple functional form and a limited number of atom types, but incorporates both empirical and heuristic models to estimate force constants and partial atomic charges. The performance of GAFF in test cases is encouraging. In test I, 74 crystallographic structures were compared to GAFF minimized structures, with a root-mean-square displacement of 0.26 Ã…, which is comparable to that of the Tripos 5.2 force field (0.25 Ã…) and better than those of MMFF 94 and CHARMm (0.47 and 0.44 Ã…, respectively). In test II, gas phase minimizations were performed on 22 nucleic acid base pairs, and the minimized structures and intermolecular energies were compared to MP2/6-31G* results. The RMS of displacements and relative energies were 0.25 Ã… and 1.2 kcal/mol, respectively. These data are comparable to results from Parm99/RESP (0.16 Ã… and 1.18 kcal/mol, respectively), which were parameterized to these base pairs. Test III looked at the relative energies of 71 conformational pairs that were used in development of the Parm99 force field. The RMS error in relative energies (compared to experiment) is about 0.5 kcal/mol. GAFF can be applied to wide range of molecules in an automatic fashion, making it suitable for rational drug design and database searching.  2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract = {Abstract NAMD is a parallel molecular dynamics code designed for high-performance simulation of large biomolecular systems. NAMD scales to hundreds of processors on high-end parallel platforms, as well as tens of processors on low-cost commodity clusters, and also runs on individual desktop and laptop computers. NAMD works with AMBER and CHARMM potential functions, parameters, and file formats. This article, directed to novices as well as experts, first introduces concepts and methods used in the NAMD program, describing the classical molecular dynamics force field, equations of motion, and integration methods along with the efficient electrostatics evaluation algorithms employed and temperature and pressure controls used. Features for steering the simulation across barriers and for calculating both alchemical and conformational free energy differences are presented. The motivations for and a roadmap to the internal design of NAMD, implemented in C++ and based on Charm++ parallel objects, are outlined. The factors affecting the serial and parallel performance of a simulation are discussed. Finally, typical NAMD use is illustrated with representative applications to a small, a medium, and a large biomolecular system, highlighting particular features of NAMD, for example, the Tcl scripting language. The article also provides a list of the key features of NAMD and discusses the benefits of combining NAMD with the molecular graphics/sequence analysis software VMD and the grid computing/collaboratory software BioCoRE.

It is designed to extend limitations in system size and accessible time scale by adopting highly parallelized schemes and enhanced conformational sampling algorithms. In this new version, GENESIS 1.1, new functions and advanced algorithms have been added. The all-atom and coarse-grained potential energy functions used in AMBER and GROMACS packages now become available in addition to CHARMM energy functions. The performance of MD simulations has been greatly improved by further optimization, multiple time-step integration, and hybrid (CPUâ€‰+â€‰GPU) computing. The string method and replica-exchange umbrella sampling with flexible collective variable choice are used for finding the minimum free-energy pathway and obtaining free-energy profiles for conformational changes of a macromolecule. These new features increase the usefulness and power of GENESIS for modeling and simulation in biological research. Â© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract  ="The principal challenge of using classical physics to model biomolecular interactions is capturing the nature of short-range interactions that drive biological processes from nucleic acid base stacking to proteinâ€“ligand binding. In particular most classical force fields suffer from an error in their electrostatic models that arises from an ability to account for the overlap between charge distributions occurring when molecules get close to each other{,} known as charge penetration. In this work we present a simple{,} physically motivated model for including charge penetration in the AMOEBA (Atomic Multipole Optimized Energetics for Biomolecular Applications) force field. With a function derived from the charge distribution of a hydrogen-like atom and a limited number of parameters{,} our charge penetration model dramatically improves the description of electrostatics at short range. On a database of 101 biomolecular dimers{,} the charge penetration model brings the error in the electrostatic interaction energy relative to the ab initio SAPT electrostatic interaction energy from 13.4 kcal molâˆ’1 to 1.3 kcal molâˆ’1. The model is shown not only to be robust and transferable for the AMOEBA model{,} but also physically meaningful as it universally improves the description of the electrostatic potential around a given molecule."}
